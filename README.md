# Front-End Interview Test

## Testing Procedure

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ostoc/frontend-code-challenge.git

$ yarn install

$ yarn run dev

```

## Important Notice

1. Only `yarn run dev` can provide expected results, due to the `CROS` limitation. Webpack is used
as a proxy to get the API call.
2. First loading time is quite long casue there is no API documentation for API, wait few seconds.

## Framework of choice

VueJS. Easy to use and allow for fast prototyping.
